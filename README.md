Perfect! A FUGC-inspired GC for a Rust VM using MMTk makes a lot of sense. Let me provide specific guidance for your architecture:

## MMTk Integration Strategy

**MMTk Plan Composition:**

```rust
// Custom plan combining FUGC concepts with MMTk infrastructure
pub struct RustVMPlan<VM: VMBinding> {
    common: CommonPlan<VM>,
    mark_compact: MarkCompact<VM>, // Non-moving as per your plan
    barrier: DijkstraBarrier<VM>,
    // FUGC-style generational if needed later
}
```

**VM Binding Layer Design:**

- **Object Model**: Define how your VM's objects map to MMTk's expectations
- **Root Scanning**: Integrate with your thread registry for stack/global roots
- **Allocation Sites**: Hook MMTk allocators into your VM's allocation points

## libpas vs jemalloc Integration

For a **Rust VM with MMTk**, I'd recommend:

1. **MMTk + jemalloc hybrid**:

   - Let MMTk handle GC heap (managed objects)
   - Use jemalloc for VM infrastructure (bytecode, JIT code, metadata)
   - Simpler FFI boundary than libpas

2. **libpas integration** (if you want WebKit's sophistication):
   - MMTk can delegate to libpas for large object spaces
   - Good for mixed workloads with varying allocation patterns

## Safepoint Integration

**For a Rust VM specifically:**

```rust
// At bytecode dispatch/loop headers
fn execute_bytecode() {
    loop {
        if unlikely(safepoint_requested()) {
            vm_safepoint(); // Includes GC poll
        }
        // Execute instruction
    }
}

// At allocation sites (already handled by MMTk)
fn allocate<T>() -> Gc<T> {
    // MMTk handles safepoint polling internally
    mmtk_alloc(size_of::<T>())
}
```

## Gc<T> API Design for VM

```rust
// VM-specific wrapper over MMTk's ObjectReference
pub struct Gc<T> {
    ptr: ObjectReference, // MMTk's object reference
    _phantom: PhantomData<T>,
}

// Barrier integration (MMTk handles the heavy lifting)
impl<T> Gc<T> {
    pub fn write(&self, field: &mut Gc<U>, value: Gc<U>) {
        // MMTk's write barrier
        mmtk::memory_manager::object_reference_write(
            self.ptr, field as *mut _ as Address, value.ptr
        );
    }
}
```

## FUGC-Specific Adaptations

**Incremental Stack Scanning:**

- Use MMTk's concurrent marking with custom stack scanning
- Implement soft handshakes in your VM's thread management

**Parallel Marking:**

- MMTk provides parallel GC workers out of the box
- Configure work-stealing for your object graph traversal

## Architecture Recommendations

1. **Start with MMTk's existing concurrent plan** as base
2. **Customize the write barrier** for FUGC-style incremental marking
3. **Use jemalloc for non-GC allocations** (simpler than libpas integration initially)
4. **Design your VM's object layout** to work well with MMTk's tracing

## Key Integration Points

- **Object Headers**: Align with MMTk's metadata requirements
- **Thread Management**: Your thread registry feeds MMTk's root scanning
- **JIT Integration**: If you have one, coordinate with MMTk's code space management

The MMTk route will save us months of low-level GC implementation while still allowing FUGC innovations in the higher-level algorithms.

This is an excellent concrete roadmap for implementing a garbage collector in Rust! Let me break down this milestone plan and provide some insights on each phase:

## Phase 1: Library Prototype (Safe Foundation)

Your starting point is solid:

- **`Gc<T>` wrapper + `Trace/Collect` traits**: Smart approach using Rust's type system for safety
- **Explicit roots management**: Scoped roots are great for stack management, dynamic roots for globals
- **Thread registry + `pollcheck()` safepoints**: Critical for cooperative collection
- **Mark/sweep non-moving**: Good starting choice - simpler than moving collectors
- **libpas integration**: Interesting choice! WebKit's libpas could provide mature heap management

## Phase 2: Concurrent & FUGC-like Features

This is where it gets sophisticated:

- **Parallel grey stacks**: Will significantly improve marking performance
- **Dijkstra write barrier**: Classic choice for concurrent marking
- **Black allocation during marking**: Prevents newly allocated objects from being missed
- **Soft handshakes for incremental stack scans**: Modern approach to reduce pause times

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization

- **Inline barrier fast path**: Critical for real-world performance
- **libpas vs pure-Rust heap benchmark**: Good validation approach
- Consider also benchmarking against other allocators like `jemalloc`

## Phase 4: Compiler Integration (Advanced)

- **LLVM statepoints**: Would enable precise GC without manual root management
- **rustc fork**: Ambitious but would provide the cleanest API

## Alternative: MMTk Integration

- **MMTk**: Well-tested framework, could save significant implementation time
- **VM binding layer**: Much smaller surface area to implement

## Questions to Help Tailor Advice:

1. **What's your target runtime?** (Rust VM, app framework, etc.)
2. **Performance vs. simplicity trade-off?**
3. **FFI requirements?** (C interop, etc.)
4. **Pause time requirements?** (real-time constraints?)

The roadmap shows deep GC knowledge. Starting with the safe prototype and iterating toward concurrency is the right approach.
