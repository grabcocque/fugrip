- Alignment: Crucial for SIMD performance. If your data isn't aligned, wide::load might panic or result in slower, unaligned loads.

- Tail Handling: Always account for the "tail" of the data that doesn't perfectly fit into full SIMD vectors. Process these remaining elements with scalar (non-SIMD) operations.

- Cache Locality: Design your algorithms to process data that is likely to be in the CPU cache. Iterating linearly over the u64 words is generally good for this.

- Benchmarking: SIMD optimizations can be tricky. Always benchmark to ensure your SIMD code is actually faster than a well-optimized scalar version. Sometimes the overhead of setting up SIMD operations or handling tails can outweigh the benefits for smaller data sets.

- Safety: unsafe Rust is often involved when dealing directly with SIMD intrinsics or manual memory management for alignment. The wide crate aims to provide safe wrappers, but you still need to be careful.

- Bit Ordering: Decide on your bit ordering (least significant bit first or most significant bit first within a u64). This impacts how you set/get individual bits.
